*) In:
    -> let's say we want to select field from specific value
    -> like in previous example inside 'country_of_birth' china, France & Brazil then:
        ->  SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth = 'China' 
            OR country_of_birth = 'France' 
            OR country_of_birth = 'Brazil';
    -> that was actually a lot of code just to include 'China', 'France' & 'Brazil' 
    -> to solve this problem we can use In keyword
    -> In keyword takes an array of values and then return a query matching those value
    -> EX:
        ->  SELECT *  
            FROM person 
            WHERE country_of_birth 
            IN ('China', 'Brazil', 'France');
        ->  SELECT * 
            FROM person 
            WHERE country_of_birth 
            IN ('China', 'Brazil', 'France') 
            ORDER BY country_of_birth;
