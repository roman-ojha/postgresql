*) Coalesce:
    -> we can handle nulls with postgres
    -> Coalesce keyword allow us to have a default value in case the first one is not present
    -> EX:
        -> SELECT COALESCE(1);
            -> Output:
             coalesce
            ----------
                    1
        -> SELECT COALESCE(null , 1) AS number;
            -> (if the first parameter is null then it will give the second value by default)
            -> Output:
             number
            --------
                1
        -> SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1) AS number;
            -> (if the first value is null then use second one if the second parameter value is null then use third one and so on and so forth)
        -> SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1, 10) AS number;
            -> Output:
             number
            --------
