*) Coalesce:
    -> we can handle nulls with postgres
    -> Coalesce keyword allow us to have a default value in case the first one is not present
    -> EX:
        -> SELECT COALESCE(1);
            -> Output:
             coalesce
            ----------
                    1
        -> SELECT COALESCE(null , 1) AS number;
            -> (if the first parameter is null then it will give the second value by default)
            -> Output:
             number
            --------
                1
        -> SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1) AS number;
            -> (if the first value is null then use second one if the second parameter value is null then use third one and so on and so forth)
        -> SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1, 10) AS number;
            -> Output:
             number
            --------
                1
    -> Let us use it for our dataset:
        -> in our 'person' database we have the email column where there is a value null in a lot of field
        -> in that case we want to select every single email and for those people that don't have email we want it to have an email with the value of email not provided
        -> SELECT COALESCE(email, 'Email not provided') FROM person;
            -> Output:
            cbellward0@newsvine.com
            Email not provided
            Email not provided
