=> here we will going to add 1000 people inside table
=> for that we will going to use mockaroo:

*) Input/Output Command
  \copy ...              perform SQL COPY with data stream to the client host
  \echo [-n] [STRING]    write string to standard output (-n for no newline)
  \i FILE                execute commands from file
  \ir FILE               as \i, but relative to location of current script
  \o [FILE]              send all query results to file or |pipe
  \qecho [-n] [STRING]   write string to \o output stream (-n for no newline)

=> after we generated '.sql' file we will going to do:
    -> for right now we will first drop the table because we have added new column on file
    -> \i D:/<path>/person.sql
    -> SELECT * from person
        -> (see inserted data)
