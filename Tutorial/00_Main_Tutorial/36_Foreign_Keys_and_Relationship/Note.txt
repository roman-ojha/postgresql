*) Foreign Keys & Relationship
    -> so far in this tutorial we have table 'person' & 'car'
    -> now what we want to do is to do query that return a combination of both person and car detail for a single person
    -> for that SQL provide us the relationship between multiple table it means that you could have multiple table and then connect them together based on a foreign key

    -> so essentially what we want to represent is:
        => Person has car
        => Person can only have one car
        => Car can belong to one person only
            -> to achieve this we have relationship 
            -> so to achieve this we have to use foreign key into to reference to the another table

    *) Relationship.png EX:
        -> So in Relationship.png we can see that on person table we have added new column:
            -> car_id BIGINT REFERENCE car(id) UNIQUE (car_id)
                -> REFERENCE is use want to reference to the another table column
                -> car(id): <table_name>(column_name)
                -> here we are using UNIQUE keyword to say that the car row with id that it is referencing can only belong to that person
                -> Or alow we are saying that person may or may not have a car
                -> and alow we are say that person can only have one car
