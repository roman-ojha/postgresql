    -> Like operator is use to match text value against the pattern using while cards
    -> let's say that we want to get the rows that contain the email ends in .com
    -> Ex:
        -> SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%.com';
            -> (wildcard follow by .com)
        -> SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%google.com';
        -> SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%google.com';
        -> SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%@google.%';
        -> SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '________@%';
            -> (single underscore has to match single character, the amount of underscore has to match that much amount of character on the start)
        -> SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '____h___@%';
