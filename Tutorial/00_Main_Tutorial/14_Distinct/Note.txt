*) Distinct:
    -> when we want unique result which doesn't get extract before then we will use Distinct
    -> like if we want to get all 'country_of_birth' but unique
        -> means we want to get same 'country_of_birth' once 
    -> syntax:
        -> SELECT DISTINCT <field> FROM <table> ORDER BY <field>;

    -> EX:
        -> SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth;
        -> SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
