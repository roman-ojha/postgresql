-> Here we will going to see how to deal with duplicate key error or exceptions
-> EX:
    -> Let's try to Insert new row in person table where we will try to add id which already exist in the table
        ->  INSERT INTO person (id, first_name, last_name, email ,gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth)
            VALUES (405, 'Ebeneser', 'Houlison', 'abc@gmail.com', 'Male', '2022-03-01', 'China');
                -> (now if we will try to run this it will try an error)

    -> But sometimes we don't want to see an error or exception, so you want to handle the case where you have conflict there comes 'ON CONFLICT' keyword
        ->  INSERT INTO person (id, first_name, last_name, email ,gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth)
            VALUES (405, 'Ebeneser', 'Houlison', 'abc@gmail.com', 'Male', '2022-03-01', 'China')
            ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
                -> (here we are trying to see is given id is making conflict if it is making conflict then we are saying to do nothing rather then throwing error)
    -> NOTE that when ever you want to use 'ON CONFLICT' make sure that your column is unique constraint or primary key constraint
