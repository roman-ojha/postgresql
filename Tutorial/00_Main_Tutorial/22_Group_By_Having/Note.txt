*) Group By Having:
    -> Having keyword work with group by
    -> It allow to perform extra filtering after you perform aggregation 
    -> let's that we group by country_of_birth but also we want to count at least 5 people
    -> see document for aggregate function: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-aggregate.html
    -> EX:
        -> SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 ORDER BY country_of_birth;
            -> (having greater then 5 people)
            -> Output:
                country_of_birth | count
