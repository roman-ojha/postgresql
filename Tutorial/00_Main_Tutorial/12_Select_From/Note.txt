=> To grab record stored inside database we have to use 'SELECT'

*) SELECT:
    -> SELECT * FROM <table>;
        -> '*': means all
        -> (select all from given table)
    -> SELECT <field_name> FROM <table>;
        -> (select only specific field from given table)
    
    EX:
        -> SELECT * from person;
        -> SELECT first_name FROM person;
        -> SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person;
        -> SELECT email FROM person;
